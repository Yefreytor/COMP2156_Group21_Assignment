## Project Description
This project is COMP2156's group assignment. The goal is to apply strategies learned in class.
The strategies applied include, CI/CD pipelines, using Github, Branching strategies and collaboration.
Each team member has their own branch that must be merged into the final build.

## Instructions
In groups, we will collaborate remotely using CI and branches. Consistently committing our changes
on our own branches, of which we maintain a proper branch naming scheme. Until finally, merging into a final "main" build.
## CI/CD Details/Pipeline
This project utilizes Github Actions for it's CI/CD implementation.
The pipeline is a slightly modified one from the project instructions.

## Branching strategy
Main is utilized as the Main branch.
Every other branch is utilized by a group member for their own work.
Those branches will be merged via Pull Requests to main.
